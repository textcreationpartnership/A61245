            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IN meer Compliance with your Earneſt Deſires I have adventur'd to Print this plain <hi>Sermon.</hi> For tho' I am ſufficiently aſſur'd, that no good Man can except againſt the Subſtance of the Diſcourſe, or the boneſty of its Deſign (which is to promote Chriſtian Charity, and Chriſtian Loyalty:) Yet I am ſo ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of its Defects upon many other Accounts, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the irreſiſtible Power of your Friendſhip could have over-rul'd and determin'd my will to this Publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I know, <hi>Sir,</hi> your Over-value for the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure proceeded from the perfect ſuitableneſs of its Matter to your Principles and Practices, which are, and alwayes have been Eminently Loyal, even in the worſt of Times, when the Faction was bold and daring and formidable, and all the ſeveral Sects of Religion
<pb facs="tcp:102493:3"/> were united witb the Men of no Religion in one joynt accurſed Conſpiracy againſt the Government: When it was accounted a Crime to be a good Subject, and all the Loyal men, by as groſs and fooliſh a Solaeciſm, as a furious and undiſtinguiſhing Malice could be guilty of, were Branded with the odious Names of <hi>Tories, Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Men, Popiſhly affected,</hi> and whatſoever might expoſe them to a popular ſcorn and hatred. But neither their falſe Pretences, nor falſe Reaſonings, nor falſe Characters could Corrupt your Judgement, nor ſhake your Conſtancy, but you continued firm and immoveable in your Duty, and upon all juſt Occaſions Bore up againſt the Rudeneſs and Inſolencies of the Faction, with a Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Reſolution which became you. And this deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly got you ſo Conſiderable an Intereſt in the Eſteem of his late Majeſty of bleſſed Memory, that He judg'd the Power of ſo large a County, as this of <hi>York,</hi> could not be intruſted, at ſo dangerous a Juncture, in ſafer hands than your own. And the faithful Diſcharge and vigorous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of your Truſt has procur'd you (no doubt) a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable Value with His preſent Majeſty. And that His Majeſty may never want a ſufficient number of ſuch Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Subjects, and that others may learn to become and continue ſuch, by your excellent Example is the hearty and unfaign'd Prayer of</p>

               <hi>I Exhort therefore, that firſt of all Supplications, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Interceſſions, and giving of thanks be made for all men:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For Kings, and all in Authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all Godlineſs and Honeſty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>RAYER is a Duty, which is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not upon Mutable and Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but fix'd and unchangeable Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. It is a Duty, which reſults from the neceſſary Relation which is betwixt the Creator and the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and is a proper expreſſion of that Homage and Worſhip, which is naturally due from Man to God the Maker and Governor of the World: It is a decent Confeſſion of the weakneſs, inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, and dependance of Man: It is a juſt Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of the Infinit Excellencies and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of God, ſuch as his Power, Wiſdom, Truth Holineſs, Goodneſs, Mercy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And therefore the Light of Nature has all along convinc'd Men of the neceſſity of this Duty, and enforc'd its Practice and Obſervation upon them. For no People, who
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:102493:4"/> believ'd a God and Providence, but teſtified this Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief by publick Adorations of the Deity, and by of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering up to him Prayers and Praiſes.</p>
            <p>And as <hi>Prayer</hi> is a neceſſary Duty, ſo alſo an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible Favour, an invaluable Privilege: It is one of the Nobleſt Exerciſes, and Divineſt Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which a Rational Creature is capable of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking: For <hi>Prayer</hi> is an Addreſs, an Aſcent of the Soul to God; It is a Talking and Diſcourſing with the Divine Majeſty. By it we have our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation in Heaven, and maintain and keep up a friendly intercourſe, an humble familiarity and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom with the Great Lord and Soveraign of the World.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Prayer</hi> is not only a Favour and Privilege, as it is a Mark of Honour put upon us by the Allowan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Condeſcentions of the Divine Goodneſs, but as it is a ſure and efficacious Means of providing for all our real and ſubſtantial Intereſts, both as we are Men and Chriſtians. For there is ſuch an invincible Power and Efficacy in <hi>Holy Prayer,</hi> that Omnipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy it ſelf ſeems not able to reſiſt it. It is repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Scripture, as if it put a Force upon the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and by a pleaſing and grateful Violence extort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe Bleſſings from him, which otherwayes he would not beſtow upon us. And this is certain, that if it be duely performed, both as to the manner and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:102493:4"/> matter of it, it never fails of its deſign, never meets with a diſappointment, but falls down in a Bleſſing, and returns laden'd with Victory and Succeſs. For God has promis'd Succeſs to its performance, by aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring us, that if <hi>we do but ask, we ſhall receive.</hi> And <note place="margin">

            <p>It is generally the Opinion of Interpreters, that thoſe ſeveral Words, which we Tranſlate <hi>Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Prayers,</hi> &amp;c. have a diſtinct meaning, and ſignifie the ſeveral Parts and Offices of Prayer. <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>The Words of the Text being thus Explain'd, they acquaint us with all the Parts of <hi>Holy Prayer,</hi> and teach us for what, and for whom we ought to make our Addreſſes to Almighty God. And from them we may make theſe two Obſervations.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. We may Obſerve, <hi>That we ought to Pray for all men.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>II. We may Obſerve, <hi>That in an eſpecial manner we ought to Pray for Kings, and all that are in Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. We may Obſerve, <hi>That we ought to Pray for all men.</hi> Theſe are the expreſs Words of the Text, and therefore there is no need of any other Proofs. or Arguments to convince us of the truth of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, or to perſwade us of the Obligation of the Duty which is contained in it. But this is no more than what is clearly intimated, and fairly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible from thoſe other Precepts of the Goſpel, which enjoyn a Catholick Charity, and an Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Good-will, and command us to do good unto all men. For <hi>Prayer</hi> is a proper effect of Charity, it being in its own nature an undenyable Expreſſion of Good-will to thoſe for whom it is exercis'd, and an infallible means, by the appointment and inſtitution of God, of doing good both to our ſelves and others.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:102493:5"/> We Pray for our ſelves becauſe we love our ſelves, and therefore if we lov'd others as we love our ſelves, we ſhould be alwayes concern'd for their happineſs, and as zealous to promote it by our Prayers, as we are to ſecure and advance our own. For Love is a powerful and operative Principle, and can no more fail to Act according to its Nature, and to Exert it ſelf in inſtances of Benevolence and Kindneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards its Objects, than Fire can ceaſe to burn and prey upon Combuſtible Matter, or than heavy Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies can leave off to move downwards, and to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue the Natural Tendency of their intrinſick Gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, when they are not reſiſted by ſome External impediments and Oppoſition.</p>
            <p>Its true indeed, that our Charity may be greater than our Power, and we may be limited and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd in the ways of exerciſing it for want of Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity or Abilities to ſhew it. Tho' one man may love all men, yet no man can Benefit every man by immediat Collation of thoſe Favours which they may ſtand in need of. No man can apply Counſel, or Adminiſter Inſtruction to all who want it. No man can by his perſonal Courage or Juſtice, reſcue all who are oppres'd or perſecuted. No man can cloath all that are naked, or feed all that are hungry, or give Alms to all who are ready to die with want and Poverty: But every man may Pray for all men, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:102493:6"/> intercede with God in their behalf. This is a way, in which any man may exerciſe his Charity towards all Mankind, and diffuſe and ſpread it over the whole World. This is a way in which every man may prove an Univerſal Benefactor, and derive Bleſſings upon all men proportionable to their reſpective needs and neceſſities. And certain it is, that if we had a ſincere and hearty Love for all men, if we unfeigned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſir'd their Happineſs and Proſperity, we ſhould alwayes remember them in our Prayers, and with a ſuitable vigour and intenſeneſs of Spirit, recommend them to the Grace and Favour of Almighty God. The ſame Divine Charity which inlarged our hearts ſo as to take in all mankind, would extend our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to a proportionable compaſs, and give every man a ſhare, and an intereſt in them. Alas! We might as ſoon forget to Pray for our ſelves, as forget to Pray for thoſe whom we love. For Charity (as I have told you already) is not an idle &amp; unconcerned Paſſion, but an Active and Vigorous Principle, full of thought and concern for thoſe on whom it is ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated, quick to diſcern, and ready to lay hold on every opportunity of doing good, reſtleſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weary in its endeavours to promote the happineſs and proſperity of its Object. And therefore if we lov'd all men, we ſhould Pray for all men, and that not only becauſe Prayer is a Powerful means of doing
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102493:6"/> good to thoſe for whom it is uſed, but alſo becauſe we have no other wayes left of exerciſing our Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and doing good to the greateſt part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
            <p>And if we would be accounted the tru and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Diſciples of Chriſt, we muſt thus Love and thus Pray for all men. No conſideration of their diſtance from us in reſpect of their Countrey; no conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of their difference from us in Matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; no conſideration of their Alienation from us in point of Aeffction muſt make us forbear either to Love or Pray for them. Tho' they live in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moteſt Parts and Corners of the World; tho' they are Enemies to God or our ſelves; tho' they are <hi>Turks, Jews, Infidels,</hi> or <hi>Hereticks;</hi> tho' they hate us to death, and proſecute us with all the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of an implacable Malice, yet ſtill when we Addreſs our ſelves to the Throne of Grace for our ſelves, for our Friends and Benefactors, for our Relations and Acquaintance, for Subjects of the ſame Kingdom, and Members of the ſame Church with our ſelves, we muſt take all the reſt of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind into our Devotions, and with a ſincere Love and Charity Pray to God for them. And in doing this, we do what is agreeable to the Dictates of our beſt Reaſon, and the Natural Equity of that Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Rule which obligeth us to do to others whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:102493:7"/> we would have them do to us. For there is no man but would have all others love him, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs that love by all ſuch wayes as are in their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of being Helpful and Beneficial to him, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently to Pray for him, if he is perſwaded that any Good can be done him by ſuch Prayers.</p>
            <p>Nay, by Praying for all men we imitate the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, and tranſcribe one of the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous Excellencies in it. For nothing can be more evident, than that God is affected with an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Benevolence towards Mankind, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually diſpenſeth the effects of ſuch an univerſal Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence. For is not his Mercy over all his Works? Does not his Providence extend to all his Creatures? and do not all men in a ſignal and eminent manner partake of the Bleſſings of it? Are not we all protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his Power, Preſerv'd by his Care, and Fed by his Bounty? and tho' men daily ſin againſt him, &amp; by ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyed and deliberat Offences affront his Government and Authority, yet does he not bear with them, and continue his former kindneſs on them? does he not cauſe his Sun to ſhine upon the juſt and unjuſt? Does he not give Rain and fruitful Seaſons to his Enemies as well as to his friends, and do they not partake alike of the Bleſſings of his common and unlimited Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence? And is not all this the effect of his Good-will? Does he not do this to try if he can Reclaim them by Favour, if his Gentleneſs and Goodneſs,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:102493:7"/> and Forbearance will lead them to Repentance? For God would not have any one Periſh, but that all ſhould Repent and be Saved. So that by Praying for all men we exerciſe and expreſs a Charity like to that of Gods, we Copy out his Univerſal and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>confined Beneficence, and in ſome meaſure become partakers of the Divine Nature. And is not God's Nature the Standard and Meaſure of the higheſt, the moſt abſolute Perfection? And muſt not we then adorn and Enoble our Natures, raiſe them up to the higheſt Pitch of Perfection by being confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to God in our Univerſal Good-will, and by Praying for all men, which is the exerciſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of ſuch Good-will?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> By <hi>Praying for all men,</hi> we follow the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of our Bleſſed Saviour, who had ſuch an hearty and ſincere Affection for Mankind, that he laid down his Life for their Sins, and offer'd up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Sacrifice of Atonement for the Tranſgreſſions of the whole World. For he taſted Death for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man, whether Friend or Enemy, and ſhed his Blood for thoſe who ſpilt it. He endur'd all the ſhame and ignominy, the pains and ſorrows of the Croſs even for thoſe, who led and faſten'd him to it; and while he was under the quickeſt ſenſe of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace and torments of his accurſed Crucifixion, his love for his Enemies was ſo far from ſuffering any
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:102493:8"/> abatement or diminution, that it broke out into the brighteſt Flame of Infinit Tenderneſs and Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and roſe as high as Heaven in a moſt Ardent Prayer for Pardon and forgive<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>neſs for his very Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors. And the ſame Benevolent Mind, the ſame Charitable Spirit appear'd in a moſt Illuſtrious manner, in the <hi>Primitive Chriſtians</hi> to the wonder and amazement of the <hi>Heathen</hi> World. For thoſe ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chriſtians liv'd that Holy Religion which they Profeſſed, and put on the Loving Nature as well as the Honourable Name of the Bleſſed Jeſus. No Injuries or Perſecutions, no Torments or Death could overcome their Charity, but this was ſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible as their Patience; this Proſper'd and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph'd amidſt the ſtrongeſt Oppoſitions, and fierceſt Provocations; this held out to the laſt, and turn'd their expiring, dying Breath, into Articulat Prayers for their Enemies, and when they could live no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, this clos'd their Eyes, and Seal'd up their Lips, and went Victoriouſly with them into another world, there to receive its utmoſt Complement and Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction by being Eternally exercis'd upon the nobleſt, the moſt raviſhing Object, God himſelf. And if we would be Chriſtians in truth and reality, as well as in Profeſſion, this Charitable Spirit, which was ſo eminently viſible in our Bleſſed Saviour and his firſt Diſciples, muſt live in and actuate us. For we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:102493:8"/> upon any other terms be either conformable to his Example, or Obedient to his Laws. And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch Conformity and ſuch Obedience we may be any thing but Chriſtians. For if we have not the Spirit of Chriſt, we are none of his, have no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to, no Intereſt in him. And it is plain, that Charity is the Spirit of Chriſt, his frame and temper of mind; Ay, Charity, as it has all mankind for its Object, and as it expreſſeth it ſelf in devout and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionat Prayers for the good and welfare of all men. And this is ſufficient to ſhew that we ought to Pray for all men.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We may Obſerve, That <hi>we ought eſpecially to Pray for Kings and all that are in Authority.</hi> Tho' our Charity ought to reach all men, and tho' we ought to expreſs it by Praying for them, yet there are peculiar Reaſons, why we ought to Pray for Kings above all men whatſoever. And theſe Reaſons are ſuch as either concern Kings themſelves, or ſuch as concern us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Such as concern Kings themſelves. For if Kings have more need of our Prayers than other men, then it is plain, that upon their account we ought eſpecially to Pray for them. And it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that they have the greateſt need of the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Interceſſions of others, if we conſider theſe following Particulars.</p>
            <pb n="12" facs="tcp:102493:9"/>
            <p> 
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Conſider that the Duty and Office of a King is an arduous and difficult Imployment. There are in moſt men an inordinat appetite after Empire and Dominion, and they greedily deſire to bear a Part in the Government of the World: But few men conſider the Difficulties of ſuch a Province, the weight and incumbrances of ſuch a Burden. For if they did but ſeriouſly conſider, what are the proper and Natural Ends of Government, what Abilities and Excellencies are neceſſary to qualify a man for the due Adminiſtration of it, what infinit pains and care muſt be undergon in the faithful diſcharge and execution of it, ſuch thoughts, ſuch reflections would mortifie the moſt aſpiring Ambition, allay and extinguiſh the moſt violent thirſts after Empire, and make men not only contented but joyful in the ſtate and condition of Subjects. For it is an eaſie thing to obey; there is required no great skill to underſtand, nor much induſtry to perform the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Subjection. It is the buſineſs of Governours to contrive the Rules, and preſcribe the Meaſures of Obedience, which generally lye in a ſmall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, and are deliver'd in plain terms, and by a clear Publication are made known to all, who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd to obſerve them. So that Subjects need not torture their Brains, nor ſtrain their underſtandings to find out and diſcover their Duties. Their work
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:102493:9"/> is Cut out to their hands and laid before their Eyes, and a tractable Nature, and an humble Spirit, and a peaceable mind will enable them to practiſe it with great eaſe and chearfulneſs.</p>
            <p>But it is far otherwiſe with Kings and Princes, who have a large Sphere to move in, and an infinit variety of Particulars to attend unto, which require an excellent Underſtanding, a Solid Judgement, a prudent foreſight, a conſtant Preſence of mind, an active Temper, an unwearyed Induſtry, a patient Spirit, an upright Intention, a Courageous Heart, a ſteady Reſolution to diſpoſe and order and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage them for the publick Good, for which Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is Inſtituted and Governours are appointed. But alas! It is not for me to Diſcourſe of the Art of Government, nor to enumerate all thoſe Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Excellencies and Qualifications, which are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to complete and furniſh out a man of Political Prudence. My buſineſs is only to convince you, that it is an hard thing to Govern wiſely, and that ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Gifts and Graces are neceſſary to make up and conſtitute a Prudent Governour, as few men enjoy, and God only can diſpenſe. And therefore we are under the ſtrongeſt Obligations of Charity to Pray for Kings, and to beſeech God that he would furniſh them with Abilities proportionable to the difficulties of their Employment, that he would direct them by
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:102493:10"/> his wiſdom and aſſiſt them by his Power, that in all caſes of Publick Concernment he would enable them to judge, determin and Execute in ſuch a manner as may beſt comply with the ends of Government, and the Reaſons of their Inſtitution.</p>
            <p>2. Conſider, that Kings are expoſed to more nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous and dangerous Temptations than other men. Temptation is a ſtate of Danger and Hazard, and no man can be ſecure in ſuch a State, who is not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du'd with ſuch a meaſure of Divine Grace, as is proportionable to the ſtrength and Violence of the Temptation. And tho' it be true, that no conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of life can boaſt of an exemption from the Aſſaults and Incurſions of Temptations, yet none is crowded and preſs'd with ſuch Numbers and ſuch variety of them, as that of Kings and Princes. As Kings are born with the ſame corrupt Natures, ſubject to the ſame vicious propenſions and inclinations, and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible of the ſame ſinful impreſſions with other men, ſo they are in greater danger than other men of being overcome by their evil Paſſions, and led Captive by their exorbitant Luſts and Appetites. For whatſoever is peculiar to them as Kings, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſheth them from the Common Condition of their Subjects, is a direct Temptation to Vice, and Miniſters both Power and Occaſion for the ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their unreaſonable Luſts and Paſſions. The
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:102493:10"/> greatneſs of their Authority, and the Incoercible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Perſons, the Vaſtneſs of their Power, and the Affluence of their Wealth and Riches are quick and powerful Incentives to Vice, ſtrong and vigorous Provocations to evil. For all theſe Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Matter and Fewel to Ambition and Pride, to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and Revenge, to Covetouſneſs and Worldly-mindedneſs, to all the Sins of Senſuality, ſoftneſs and Luxury. And we may be ſure that the Devil will be watching all Opportunities to preſs theſe Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations upon them with all the force and advantage imaginable. For the Devil very well knows, that the Intereſt of his Helliſh Kingdom and the ſucceſs of his Malicious Deſigns do in an extraordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner depend upon the Power, which he gets over Kings and Princes. For Vice is never ſo infectious as in their Examples. This gives Reputation and Authority to it: This renders it bold and inſolent: This procures it avowed Patrons and ſhameleſs Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of its Cauſe and Intereſts, and makes it ſpread and diffuſe it ſelf in every part of a Nation with a boundleſs and uncontrollable Licence.</p>
            <p>To this I may add, That it is not the leaſt part of the Misfortune and Danger, which Kings labour under, that they have few Friends and many Flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers: Few, that will deal plainly with them, that will tell them of their Faults, admoniſh them of their
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:102493:11"/> Errors, or put them in mind of their Duty; but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that will ſooth them in their Miſtakes, applaud their very Vices, commend their very Deformities, put the brighteſt Colours upon their fouleſt Actions and turn their ſhame and reproach to their Glory. So that, theſe things confider'd, we have great reaſon to ſay, <hi>God help Poor Kings,</hi> we have great reaſon to pity them for the Eminency of their Station and the uncontrollableneſs of their Power, which indeed is ſo Neceſſary for us, but ſo dangerous to themſelves, wh<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ch derives ſo many daily Bleſſings upon us, but expoſeth them to ſo many continual Temptations: We have great reaſon to Pray to God for ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary meaſures and ſupplies of his Grace for them, as may defend them againſt their extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Temptations, and ſecure their Innocency and Vertue from being overcome by the Violence of their aſſaults, and the importunity of their Sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>
            <p>3. Conſider, That Kings have more Enemies, and are in more danger than other men. Tho' Kings Adminiſter their Government and manage Publick Affairs with never ſuch an equal hand and prudent a Conduct, yet it is impoſſible to pleaſe and content the minds of all their Subjects, but ſtill there will be ſome Sons of <hi>Belial,</hi> ſome factious and ſeditious Spirits, who either out of Envy or Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:102493:11"/> out of Covetouſneſs or Revenge, out of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſtick Principles or falſe Maxims in Religion, will be Plotting againſt their Government and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring againſt their Perſons. Nay, the juſteſt, the beſt Princes have oftentimes the moſt Enemies, and are in greateſt danger of being deſtroy'd by cloſe and Treacherous Arts, or by open and publick Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections. For bad men are uneaſie and reſtleſs under a juſt Government, and impatient of thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints, which wholſome Laws and equitable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions put upon them. Good Laws are againſt their evil Deſigns, and therefore they are againſt good Kings, who are the Fountains and Guardians of good Laws, and out of their Princely Goodneſs take care to have them ſtrictly Obſerv'd and Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. We have had in our Nation too great a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of this ſad Truth in the Accidents, which befel our <hi>two laſt Kings of bleſſed Memory;</hi> the firſt of which dyed by the hands of a bloody Violence, becauſe he would not offer Violence to the publick Laws of the Land and the Religious Dictates of his own Conſcience. And the other had infallibly ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded him in the calamity of his Fate, as he did in the Juſtice and Mercy of his Government, if God by an extraordinary and Miraculous Providence had not prevented it. So that Kings by the Height and Eminence of their Station are ſo far from being Plac'd
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:102493:12"/> above the reach of Miſchief, that they are thereby the more expoſed to it, and are only fairer marks for evil men to take Aim at, to level and direct their Rage and Fury againſt them. Kings in this reſpect are like Tall Oakes, which are the moſt obnoxious to the Blaſts of Storms and Tempeſts, to the Strokes of Thunder and Lightning. And certain it is, that it would be impoſſible for Kings to ſit ſafely and peaceably upon their Thrones for any conſiderable time, if they were not in a peculiar manner the Care of Heaven, and the Charge of the Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. No Guards could ſecure, no Force could protect them, if God did not in a particular manner Watch over them, keep them under the ſhadow of his Wings, blaſt the Deſigns and reſtrain the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty of their Enemies. <hi>It is only God, who doth and can give Salvation to Kings, and delivereth David</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 144. 10.</note> 
               <hi>his ſervant from the peril of the Sword.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And how ſhould this Conſideration make us fall down upon our Knees and lift up our hearts in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to God for the ſafety and preſervation of Kings, for their defence and Protection from all the evil De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns and bloody Machinations, from the ſecret Plots and open Violence of their cruel and implacable Enemies.</p>
            <p>2. There are particular Reaſons, which concern our ſelves, and which oblige us eſpecially to Pray for Kings. For</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:102493:12"/> 1. Conſider, That it is all our Intereſts to Pray for Kings. For our Happineſs and Proſperity is bound up and included in theirs, and whatſoever good we do them by our Prayers or any other means, we all ſhare in the Advantage of it, and the Bleſſing, which falls upon them, like the Sacred Oyle, which was powr'd upon <hi>Aaron</hi>'s head, runs down to the very Skirts of their Garments, deſcends upon the meaneſt of their Subjects, who all enjoy it in ſome kind and in ſome meaſure or other, in the excellent Effects and Fruits of their Government.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Civil Peace</hi> is one of the greateſt Bleſſings of this World: It is that, which makes our Lives a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and gives relliſh and ſweetneſs to all our other injoyments. But there can be no Peace without Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, nor Government without Laws, nor Laws without an Authority to Enact and Execute them. Now, this Authority is Veſted in Kings, tho' as to the Exerciſe of it, it may be variouſly Modify'd, Bounded and Limited according to the Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Conſtitutions of ſeveral Kingdoms. So that, we owe all our Peace, and all the Bleſſings, which are derivable from it, to Kings and Princes. It is their Conduct and Government, which ſecures unto us our Lives, our Poſſeſſions, our Rights and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. It is that which preſerves us from being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd by others, from being deſtroy'd by our ſelves.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:102493:13"/> It is that, which prevents and repells Hoſtile Invaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and deſcents from Abroad; It is that, which hinders Confuſions and quells Inſurrections at Home: So that all our Temporal Happineſs is bound up in that of the Kings, we proſper and flouriſh with him, and we all in common partake of his Felicity or his Misfortunes. And therefore as it is our Intereſt, that Kings ſhould enjoy a long and uninterrupted Health, that they ſhould improve in Wiſdom and Knowledge, that they ſhould grow in Goodneſs and Juſtice and all manner of Vertue, that they ſhould increaſe in Honour and Reputation and Power both at Home and Abroad, ſo it is our Intereſt to Pray for all theſe things for them. For in all this we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe a Charity towards our ſelves, we are but our own Benefactors, and all the while are providing for our own Peace and Safety.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider, That we are bound in Gratitude to Pray for Kings. The Benefits, which we receive from their Government, ought to affect us with a ſuitable Eſteem and Value for their Perſons, and oblige us to all the Returns of Love and Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which we are capable of making. The ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Heathens</hi> ſtyl'd their Governours Benefactors, and look'd upon them with a Reverence, and pay'd them Honours anſwerable to ſuch an endearing and obliging Character. And the Holy Scriptures de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:102493:13"/> deſcribe and repreſent Kings under ſuch forms of Expreſſion, as if all the good things we enjoy, were the iſſues of their Providence, the effects of their Wiſdom, Care and Bounty. Thus <hi>David</hi> is ſtyl'd <note place="margin">2 <hi>Sam</hi> 21. 17.</note> 
               <hi>the Light of Iſrael.</hi> As if what the Sun is to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial World, <hi>David</hi> was the ſame to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> State, diſpenſing Life and Motion and Vigour to all within the Orbit of his Soveraign Authority by the quickening Rays, the cheriſhing Influences of his Wiſdom, Power and Goodneſs. And tho' this was ſaid of <hi>David,</hi> who was a good King and a man af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Gods own heart, yet no leſs is ſaid of <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> who was an Enemy to Goodneſs and good Men. For even he is called by the Prophet <hi>Jeremy, the breath of our Noſtrils:</hi> Which plainly intimates, that <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lam.</hi> 4. 20.</note> Kings are as neceſſary to the Being and Preſervation of the Body Politick, as Air is to that of the Body Natural. And tho' bad Kings are like bad Air, which Vitiates the Blood and Spirits, weakens the Faculties and impaires the Strength and Firmneſs of the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Conſtitution, yet as the Miſchiefs of a bad Air are not ſo great and deſtructive as a total deprivati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, ſo the Miſeries and Plagues of Tyranny are not ſo intollerably calamitous, as thoſe of Anarchy and Confuſion. For where there is confuſion, there is every evil work, and when Government is once broke up, then men are let looſe upon one another,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:102493:14"/> and are at liberty to act all the Villanies and Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Barbarous Inhumanities, which their Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Luſts and Paſſions can tempt them to. And it is an Obvious and common Obſervation, that more Rapin and Oppreſſion and cruel Outrages have been Committed, and more Blood has been ſpilt in our Late <hi>Civil Wars,</hi> than ever was done in the Reign of the moſt Inhuman and Mercileſs Tyrant, which ſway'd a Scepter in any Place whatſoever. So that Tyranny is better than no Government at all, and tho' particular Perſons ſuffer by it, yet the far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of the Community is Oblig'd and receive ſuch Benefits even under ſuch an harſh and ſevere Adminiſtration, as they could not enjoy in a ſtate of Licentiouſneſs and Confuſion. And therefore the whole Body of the People is bound in Gratitude to Pray for the ſafety and Preſervation of the worſt Kings, becauſe there are none ſo bad, but do good to the Nation in general, over which they exerciſe their Authority.</p>
            <p>And if Subjects are Indebted to the worſt of Kings, how much more then to the good and Gentle, to thoſe who have an univerſal Good-will for their People, who exerciſe a tender and paternal Care over them, and ſtudy to preſerve them in Wealth, Peace and Godlineſs? Such Princes are the greateſt Bleſſings which Heaven can beſtow upon us; for
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:102493:14"/> they purſue the natural and proper Ends of their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and imploy their Power for all thoſe uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and beneficial Purpoſes, for which it is given them. They do not Rule ſo much for themſelves, as for us, and are indeed eventually as well as deſignedly the Miniſters of God to us for good.</p>
            <p>And can we ever be too much affected with the ſenſe of their Favours and Benefits? Can we ever be ſufficiently Grateful for them? Or can we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs our Gratitude in too many hearty and affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Prayers to God for them? Surely, we cannot but look upon our ſelves Oblig'd to do them all the good we can, who are the Authors of ſo much good, the Diſpenſers of ſo many Bleſſings to us. And therefore, if by our Prayers we can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to their Intereſts and advantage, We muſt needs think our ſelves bound in Gratitude to aſſiſt them with ſuch a cheap, ſuch an eaſie way of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing our Good-will and charity towards them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Conſider, That as Prayer is the beſt means we can uſe to make Kings wiſe and juſt and merciful and proſperous in their Government, ſo alſo Prayer is the only means allow'd us by God for Redreſſing thoſe Grievances and Miſchiefs, which at any time we may ſuffer from the violent abuſe of their Power, and the irregular Adminiſtration of their Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. For if Princes are bad Men, and Oppreſs their
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:102493:15"/> Subjects againſt Reaſon and againſt Law, we have no remedy left us, but Prayers to God, in whoſe hands are the Hearts of Kings, and who can turn and diſpoſe them, as ſeemeth beſt to his Godly Wiſdom. They are God's Miniſters and act by his Authority, and therefore for his ſake we muſt be ſubject to them. Whatſoever Injuries they heap upon us; whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Violences and Perſecutions we ſuffer under them, we muſt not permit our Paſſions to riſe and ſwell againſt them, nor vent themſelves in unduti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Language, in indecent Reflections, in ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Reproaches, in Factious Complaints or Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Murmurings; much leſs muſt we take up Arms, and by Force Reſiſt their Perſons or Authority. For the Apoſtle hath told us in expreſs terms, <hi>That we muſt be Subject not only for wrath but conſcience.</hi>

Nay, the ſame Apoſtle, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage us for ever from any Rebellious Attempts and forcible Reſiſtance, has aſſur'd us, that we cannot Reſiſt but at the certain Peril of our immortal Souls, <hi>for they that reſiſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhall receive to themſelves dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi> So that, how diſtreſſed, how afflicted ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver our Condition may prove through the Arbitrary and Mercileſs Executions of a Tyrannical Prince, we muſt not make uſe of any other Weapons againſt
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:102493:15"/> him, than what God has put into our hands, which are only Prayers and Tears: We muſt no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes oppoſe him than by deſiring of God, that he would convert him to the love of Truth and Juſtice and Mercy; or at leaſt reſtrain him from his Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and Outragious Practiſes. And this very Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration is ſufficient to convince us, <hi>That we ought eſpecially to Pray for Kings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Conſider, That by Praying for Kings we do that which in a peculiar manner is pleaſing to God and agreeable to his will. And therefore, not to Pray at all for them, or to Pray for them with a cold and lazy and unconcerned Indifference is to be negligent and Remiſs in a Duty, which God in an eſpecial manner has oblig'd us unto. St. <hi>Paul</hi> having exhorted <hi>Timothy</hi> to take care in the firſt place that this Duty be performed, he enforceth his Exhortation by telling him, <hi>that this is good and acceptable unto God.</hi> ver. 3. And we cannot but look upon it as a thing good in it ſelf to Pray in an eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al manner for Kings, becauſe it is ſuch an Exerciſe of Charity, ſuch a demonſtration of Gratitude: and we have as much reaſon to believe it acceptable to God, becauſe it is good in it ſelf, becauſe it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the Divine Will, and done in obedience to God's particular and expreſs Commandment. And therefore if we would live in an humble Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:102493:16"/> to God, and enjoy his Favour, which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd only on the condition of ſuch an Obedience, we muſt pray eſpecially for Kings, who are God's Miniſters, the Repreſentatives of his Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, the great Inſtruments of his Providence in Governing the World.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If we ought eſpecially to Pray for Kings, then this ſhews how little of true Chriſtianity, how little of the Goſpel-ſpirit and temper there is in thoſe people, who are ſo far from Praying for Kings, that they bear a Malicious Spight, an Implacable Hatred againſt them; that Curſe the King in their thoughts and wiſh him evil in their hearts; that would rejoice at any diſaſtrous Fate or untimely End, which ſhould befal Him. If this be their Praying for the King, it is a ſaying their Prayers backwards, a ſort of Devotion, which thoſe wretched Creatures are ſaid to uſe, who enter into Leagues and Compacts with the Devil. And certain it is, That ſuch kind of Praying is an immediat Diſpoſition, the very next ſtep to Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, which is as the ſin of Witchcraft.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From hence we may learn to what cauſes we may Aſcribe the Failures and Irregularities of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the Mal-adminiſtration and Miſcarriages of their Government. Whatſoever is amiſs in their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we are apt to impute it ſolely to their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and infirmities, to their Follies and Paſſions, or
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:102493:16"/> to ſome prevailing Luſt and domineering Vice in them. For, becauſe the Conduct and management of Publick Affairs is in their hands, we never look fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the Cauſes of publick miſcarriages than to their very Perſons, from whom they immediatly proceed. And thus we never Conſider, how much it is in our Power to make Kings better or worſe, and that the ſafety of their Perſons, the Holineſs of their Lives, the Wiſdom and Juſtice and Proſperity of their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment do in a great meaſure depend upon the Charity of our Prayers, the Piety and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our Converſations. For there is ſuch a poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Relation, ſuch a Civil Union between Kings and their People, and their Intereſts are ſo involv'd and interwoven with one another, that their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Virtues or Vices affect each other with a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and reciprocal Influence, and recommend each other to the Favour or Expoſe to the diſpleaſure of God Almighty. Thus God ſometimes withdraws his Grace and Protection from a good King, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers him to fall into Sin or Miſchief for the ſake of a wicked and perverſe People. This appears in the Inſtances of Holy <hi>David</hi> and that good King <hi>Joſiah.</hi>

               </note>
            </p>
            <p>And this may teach us to look at Home, and to ſearch within our own hearts for the Diſcovery of the Cauſes, to which the Errors of Governours, and the miſchief of their Government are owing. For
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:102493:17"/> ſeeing God has appointed us to Pray in an eſpecial manner for Kings, we may be ſure, that there is ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and efficacy in our Prayers to enable Governours to diſcharge their Office and Adminiſter publick Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs wiſely, juſtly and Religiouſly; and if at any time or in any Inſtance they do otherwiſe, have we not reaſon to conclude, that the fault originally is in our ſelves, and that it ſo happens, becauſe we either neglect to Pray for Kings, or elſe we do not Pray for them in ſuch a devout, affectionat and importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat manner as we ought?</p>
            <p n="3">3. This ſhews the excellency of the <hi>Liturgy</hi> &amp; <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Service</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> in this point of Chriſtian Doctrine; how Evangelical in this reſpect it is in its Frame and Contrivance; how Apoſtolical in its Compoſure and Conſtitution with relation to the Duty, which we owe to Kings and Princes. For how amply and largely has it provided for our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions in this inſtance? How many <hi>Collects</hi> and <hi>Prayers</hi> does it contain for the King? And how are we taught by thoſe Collects and Prayers to Petition God for every thing, which concerns our King in all his Capacities and Relations, and which are any ways neceſſary to make him happy and proſperous as a Man, as a Chriſtian and as a King? And in what ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant Words, and pathetick Expreſſions are thoſe Prayers delivered, ſuch as are proper to inform the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:102493:17"/> dulleſt underſtanding and inflame the coldeſt Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? And this perhaps is one great Reaſon, why thoſe, who are Enemies to the King, are ſuch Enemies to our Liturgy, and have all along endeavour'd the Abolition of the one, as well as the Deſtruction of the other. But God be thank'd, we have not ſo learn'd Chriſt, as to deſpiſe his Publick Solemn Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, becauſe it is ſuch a friend to the Perſon and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of his Vicegerent, and is ſo conformable to the Divine Will in ſuch a main and important Duty of Chriſtianity. No, we, I hope, ſhall value more and more the Liturgy of our Church, and take all Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions to joyn in the Publick performance of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ſuch an excellent Guide to our Devotions, and teacheth us in ſuch various and comprehenſive and lively forms to Pray for our King, and all in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority under him.</p>
            <p>But then withal I muſt crave leave to tell you, that if we would have our Prayers, which we either put up for our King or for our ſelves, to ſucceed and Prevail for a Bleſſing, we muſt take care, that they be the breathings of a devout mind, the iſſues of a pure heart, and proceed from a Soul intirely reſign'd and dedicated to the Service of God. For all ſin wilfully indulg'd vitiates and corrupts the Efficacy of Prayer, diſarms it of its ſtrength and power, and turns it into ſo much fruitleſs and inſignificant wind,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:102493:18"/> which is ſpent to no manner of purpoſe. For God is an utter and irreconcileable Enemy to all ſin; he cannot look upon it without infinit Abhorrence, nor upon thoſe, who deliberatly practiſe it, without a proportionable Averſation. His Ears are deaf to all their Prayers, and it is neither the number nor Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of their Addreſſes, which can ſoften and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him pliant and yielding to them. <hi>If I regard Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me,</hi> ſaith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid;</hi> and God heareth not Sinners is a truth, which the blind man in the Coſpel could diſcern by the light and evidence of his own Reaſon.</p>
            <p>So that if we would Pray ſucceſsfully, we muſt live Holily: we muſt mortifie in us all vicious luſts and affections: we muſt abſtain from all manner of wilful and deliberat wickedneſs: we muſt endeavour an univerſal and impartial Obedience to all the Laws of the Goſpel. And then our Prayers thro' the merits of Chriſt will be as Incenſe, a grateful Perfume, a Sacrifice of a ſweet ſmelling ſavour to Almighty God: Then all our Prayers for the King will have a bleſſed iſſue and a ſucceſsful event, and will return in ſhowers of bleſſings upon him and upon us, to the great and unſpeakable Comfort of all our Lives.</p>
            <p>But I muſt not forget to tell you, that as we ought to Pray for the King, ſo we ought to thank God for him. Not only Supplications, Prayers, Interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:102493:18"/> but alſo giving of thanks muſt be made for all men, for Kings and all in Authority.</p>
            <p>Nothing is more natural than to be grateful to our Benefactors, and he is a Benefactor to us, who doth good to thoſe, whom we ſincerely love, and whoſe happineſs we earneſtly deſire. Charity, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends our regards and deſires beyond our own parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular intereſts, multiplies every favour, every mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, which is beſtow'd upon any ſingle individual Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, into as many real kindneſſes and diſtinct Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, as there are men who wiſh and deſire the Happineſs of that Perſon. And therefore if we had ſo much charity for the King, as ardently and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly to Pray for his happineſs, we could not fail to bleſs God, whenſoever we found our Prayers an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd in any inſtance of his welfare and preſervation.</p>
            <p>But mercies and favours, which are beſtow'd upon the King, are not only favours to us, becauſe we have a Chriſtian Charity and affection for him, as we ought to have for every man living; but they are favours to us, becauſe they enable him to derive upon us all the Bleſſings of a wiſe, a juſt and peaceable Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For we are to conſider the King as a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Perſon, and therefore beſides that moral Union, which is made by Love; there is a Civil and Political Union between him and us, which reſults from the Relation, which he bears to us, as ſupream head and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:102493:19"/> Governour. And upon this account every mercy, which God confers upon the King, is a publick mercy, a mercy as univerſal as his Government, and Coex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive with his whole Dominions. It is not confin'd and limited to his Royal Perſon, but has an influence upon the whole Community, &amp; in its effects and ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations reacheth every Member of the Body Politick. So that benefits and favours, which God vouchſafeth to Kings and Princes, are in this reſpect like fruitful and refreſhing Showers, which fall upon high and lofty Mountains, and then deſcend and trickle down upon the Plains or Valleys beneath, and impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate them with a rare and admirable Fertility.</p>
            <p>Now, how great and manifold are the Mercies and Benefits, which God has confer'd upon our Gracious Soveraign? and therefore what ſtrong and indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Obligations do we lye under to praiſe and adore the Divine Goodneſs for him?</p>
            <p>How ought we to thank God for the wonderful Preſervation of our King throughout the whole courſe of his Life, for the Miraculous deliverance of him from thoſe eminent and apparent dangers, which he has been expos'd to both at Home and Abroad, in his own and in Forreign Countreys, at Sea and at Land, in times of Peace and in times of War? How ought we to thank God for his quiet and peaceable Succeſſion to the Throne, and that in deſpight of the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:102493:19"/> extravagant fears, and wild jealouſies, and deſperat reſolutions; in deſpight of the rage and madneſs of the People?</p>
            <p>How ought we to thank God for all thoſe Royal and Princely Virtues, which enoble his Mind, adorn his Government, and render his Adminiſtration ſo juſt and eaſie, and conſequently ſo great a bleſſing to his People?</p>
            <p>How ought we to thank God for thoſe fix'd and unalterable Purpoſes of his Mind to Govern us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Law, to preſerve unto us all our Civil Rights and Spiritual Privileges? And how ought we to thank God for thoſe ſeveral and repeated Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, which the King has given the whole Nation of thoſe his Royal Purpoſes, Aſſurances! which can no more fail us, than he can ceaſe to be that juſt, that Gracious and Generous Prince, which he is?</p>
            <p>How ought we to thank God for that late and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Victory, which he gave him over his Rebellious Subjects, and thereby deliver'd both him and us from the worſt of Enemies, Enemies to our God and Holy Religion! Enemies to all, that can be dear and valuable to us! Enemies who would have ſtuck at no Methods, ſhrunk at no Villany to have deſtroy'd the Government both in Church and State. This is a vaſt and incomparable mercy, and loudly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims to the whole World, that God has a more
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:102493:20"/> than ordinary tenderneſs and care for our Gracious Soveraign, and that whoſoever takes up Arms againſt his Authority, Fights againſt Heaven, and not only breaks thro' all the moral Obligations of the Divine Will (which has forbid all reſiſtance of the Supream Power) but even vainly ſtrives againſt the natural force and invincible ſtrength of the Almighty Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. So that every Rebel has all the reaſon in the World, without true and unfeigned Repentance, to expect Damnation both in this life and in that to come.</p>
            <p>And can we now ſeriouſly reflect upon theſe vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and infinit mercies, which God has beſtow'd upon the King, and not be affected with a due and ſuitable ſenſe of them? Or can we be affected with ſuch a ſenſe, and not feel our ſelves prompted with all the force and vigour of an ingenuous Gratitude to be thankful to God for them? Or can we be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſincerely thankful for them, and not make that due uſe and improvement of them for which they are intended?</p>
            <p>Now what is the uſe, which we ought to make of all theſe Mercies, but to look upon them as ſo many Arguments and Motives to an Holy Life, ſo many Encouragements to repent of thoſe Sins, which we have committed againſt God, and to continue in that juſt and indiſpenſible Allegiance which we owe our
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:102493:20"/> Soveraign Lord the King? But how can we do this, ſo long as we liſten to every diſloyal Whiſper, and factious Murmurings and ſpightful Suggeſtions and reproachful Inſinuations, which are contriv'd and propagated by diſaffected and evil men to Expoſe His Majeſties Perſon and Government to contempt and hatred, and to diſpoſe and prepare his Subjects for Rebellion and Inſurrections?</p>
            <p>And therefore, let us have a care, how we give countenance and credit to any Factious and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Stories, how we admit or cheriſh any Popiſh fears and jealouſies, which, by as great a Miracle as that of Tranſubſtantiation, converts every idle Chimaera into a Reality, and every improbable fiction into a ſolid Truth; which Robs men of their Senſes and their Reaſon, and will not ſuffer them to believe the plain evidence of either. For is any thing more obvious to Senſe, than that His Majeſty takes all the meaſures of his Government from the Direction of the Laws? And is any thing more reaſonable to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, than that he will never vary from his preſent Practiſe, nor depart from the Publick Conſtitutions? Have we not the higheſt moral Aſſurance of this, which a breaſt inſpir'd with ſincerity, Juſtice and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity, can give to the World? What is it then that people would have? Would they be happier, than God and the King can make them? If not, why
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:102493:21"/> do they not ſtudy to be quiet, and do their own buſineſs? Why are they not content to enjoy all the Privileges and Comforts of our holy Religion, and all the Advantages and Bleſſings of our excellent Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Government? Why do they not diſcourage all ſeditious Talk and factious Rumours? Why do they not Pray for the King, and thank God for him, as Chriſtians ought to do, &amp; which if we could be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to do heartily and affectionatly, we ſhould be ſo far from lifting up an hand, that we ſhould not ſo much as lift up a thought againſt the King or his Government, but ſhould be glorious Ornaments to our holy Religion, by being Illuſtrious Examples of Loyalty and Obedience, which God make us thro' the Power of his holy Spirit for Chriſt Jeſus's ſake, to whom with the Father and Holy Ghoſt, three Perſons and one God, be aſcribed, as is moſt due, all Might, Majeſty, Dominion and Praiſe both now and for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>
